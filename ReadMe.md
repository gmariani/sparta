## Description
.sparta is an Adobe AIR based utility. It allows you to edit .mxi files and create new ones. It currently supports the majority of the MXI specification with the goal of supporting all of it. I made this program because I was tired of all the half-assed MXI editing programs that were built with Flash MX 2004 and some random swf to exe program. I also tended to forget what options I had when creating an MXI for my own components. So I created .sparta, it has a (hopefully) intuitive interface and shows ALL the options MXI can support.

## Features
- Scalable UI
- Drag-n-Drop support
- Create MXI files
- Edit MXI files
- Auto-update capability
- Tool-Tips describing every feature
- Create mxi files for Fireworks, Dreamweaver and Flash
